ðŸ¤– Webpage Q&A Chatbot

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built with Streamlit and LangChain, allowing you to query the contents of any webpage. It loads a webpage, chunks and embeds the text, stores it in a FAISS vector database, and answers your questions using a lightweight Groq-hosted LLM.

This repository also includes example notebooks demonstrating basic RAG with both web content and Wikipedia.
